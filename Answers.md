# Class Design and Implementation Case

#### A large company with locations in different cities has taken an OOP approach in creating an administration program that manages all aspects of its business. These aspects include:
#### ·the sale of all the different products that the company manages
#### ·the salaries for managers, office staff and sales personnel.


#### 1.(a) By making use of an example from the above scenario, distinguish between a class and an instantiation of a class. (3 points)
> A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of objects. An instantiation of a class, also known as an object, is a specific instance created based on that class.

#### The different modules in the program each open a graphical user interface (GUI). Each GUI has a similar design but contains differences specific to each module.

#### (b) By giving two examples, explain how the principles of inheritance can be incorporated into the design of this administration program. (4 points)
>Examples of incorporating inheritance in the administration program design could be:
>Having a base class for GUI design with common features, and deriving specific GUI classes for each module with additional unique features.
>Creating a base class for employee salaries and deriving subclasses for managers, office staff, and sales personnel, inheriting the common salary functionality.

(c) The use of libraries can facilitate development by providing pre-built code modules that offer specific functionalities. These libraries save time and effort as developers can leverage existing code rather than starting from scratch. It promotes code reuse, improves efficiency, and allows developers to focus on the core aspects of the program.
